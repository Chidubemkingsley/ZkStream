# ðŸŽ¬ ZkStream â€“ Use Case Storyboard
![image](./assets/zkstream.png)
### 1. **The Problem**

* In todayâ€™s digital world, **data streams are everywhere**: live video, IoT sensors, financial market feeds, medical monitors.
* But once streamed, **how can anyone prove the integrity** of what was broadcast without storing gigabytes of raw data?
* Regulators, auditors, and users need **verifiable guarantees** that the stream wasnâ€™t tampered with.

---

### 2. **The Solution â€“ ZkStream**

* ZkStream lets users **start a live stream**, automatically hashing each frame or data chunk in real-time.
* These hashes are bundled into a **cryptographic commitment**.
* The commitment is sent to **zkVerify/Horizen**, producing a **zero-knowledge proof** that:

  * âœ… The stream happened at a specific time.
  * âœ… The stream data was not altered.
  * âœ… The proof can be verified publicly *without revealing the full stream*.

### 3. **How it Works (Storyboard Flow)**

ðŸ“Œ **Step 1 â€“ Streaming Starts**

* A journalist begins streaming a live protest.
* ZkStream hashes the video frames locally.

ðŸ“Œ **Step 2 â€“ Commitments Created**

* Hashes are chained (Poseidon/Merkle) â†’ final root is generated.

ðŸ“Œ **Step 3 â€“ Proof on zkVerify**

* The root is submitted to zkVerify, where a **ZKP proof** is generated.
* Verifiers donâ€™t need the video, just the proof + verification key.

ðŸ“Œ **Step 4 â€“ Immutable Proof**

* Regulators, platforms, or courts can later **verify authenticity** with one click.
* No need to store the raw 10GB stream, just the lightweight proof.

### 4. **Use Case Scenarios**

1. **Media Rights & Journalism** â€“ Verifiable proof that a livestream was authentic, not deepfaked or tampered.
2. **IoT / Industry Compliance** â€“ Proof that sensor readings (e.g., emissions, temperature logs) were faithfully recorded.
3. **Financial Streaming Data** â€“ Guarantee that market feeds were unaltered during audits or disputes.
4. **Medical Devices** â€“ Prove that continuous patient monitoring streams were not tampered with.

### 5. **Why zkVerify + Horizen?**

* zkVerify provides a **scalable, public verification layer**.
* Anyone can validate proofs without needing access to private data.
* Horizen ensures interoperability + trust for real-world compliance scenarios.

### ðŸ“Š **Impact Highlights (to show judges)**

* **Innovation** â€“ New primitive: verifiable proof-of-stream.
* **Relevance** â€“ Built on zkVerify/Horizen for real-world trust.
* **Technical Depth** â€“ Proof generation, commitments, blockchain integration.
* **Polish** â€“ Hosted demo, clean README, screenshots, upcoming video pitch.
